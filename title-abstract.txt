Title:
Using Predictive and Generative AI to Detect Truthfulness in News Articles

Abstract:
The issue of fraudulent and misleading news has been an issue for as long as
humans can remember, but today it is more rampant than ever with online
news and social media giving everyone the chance to stay up to date with
news worldwide. With the development of AI, there is the opportunity to ei-
ther extenuate the increasing amount of misinformative news or to mitigate
it. Previous approaches have brushed the surface, with many fact-checking
websites leading the way in debunking non-factual statements made by var-
ious sources, but the development of generative AI has opened new doors
that have allowed for new techniques to develop. This project will continue
to push the needle towards minimizing misinformation and disinformation
from media sources through predictive AI and generative AI machine learn-
ing methods. By finding new data that is specific to this task, along with
developing models addressing many different factors that go into detecting
misinformation, this project will be a culmination of the most important fac-
tors contributing to mis/disinformation which is unlike many other projects
previous. The final product will be an interface that is able to intake a news
article, process the contents using predictive and generative AI, and return
how true it is by providing text describing the truths/falsities, along with a
truthfulness score from 1-100.
